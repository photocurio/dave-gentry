<a href="NewHomebuilderPlans.html">Back</a> Baffin Bay <a href="Home.html">Home</a>
<p><b>17&#39; 5&quot; x 22&quot;{5.3m x 55cm}</b></p>

<p>The Baffin Bay is a beautiful sea kayak based on &quot;KNK 1550x18&quot; - a historic example of a traditional qajaq displayed in the
Greenland National Museum. Comfortable, and wide for a Greenland kayak, she&#39;s fast,paddles great and is quite stable for her
beam - but still rolls easily. Modifications from the original design include a longer cockpit (to fit a standard sized spray skirt),
and a slightly higher deck for increased leg room. Her performance remains true to the historic design.</p>

<p>From ocean swells to backyard ponds - you can take this boat anywhere you&#39;d take any plastic, wooden or fiberglass sea kayak . . .
         but with twice the style. And, at half their weight (about 30lbs/13kg), she&#39;s easy to carry and car-top for anyone.</p>

<p>Maximum recommended paddler size is 210lbs/96kg.</p>

<p>This boat is a little longer than the Disko Bay kayak, though their cockpits are essentially the same size. 
	The stems are considerably shorter than the DB&#39;s, so that - combined with
her greater length - gives the Baffin Bay greater carrying capacity and a bit more stability. 
Lighter weight paddlers (under 140lbs/64kg) found the prototype to weathercock 
rather more than necessary, but the prototype was built shorter than the original. 
The current version is back to the original size, with the paddler&#39;s weight in the correct position.</p>

<p>
	Plans include full sized patterns for the frames, stems and cockpit, plus a well illustrated building guide covering everything you need to know to build the boat. Plans are in both
								imperial and metric measurements.
