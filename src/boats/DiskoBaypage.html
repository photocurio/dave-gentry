  <h1>1931 Kayak from Disko Bay, Greenland</h1>
  <h2>16'6" × 21.5" (5.03m × 54.6cm) or 18' × 23"</h2>

  <p class="highlight">
    To my mind, the 1931 Disko Bay is one of <em>the</em> classic West Greenland style qajaqs, and it has been
    reproduced in large numbers by builders looking for an authentic and great handling boat.
  </p>
  
  <p class="highlight">
    The Disko Bay is fast, comfortable, stable and rolls exceptionally well - a
    perfect all around boat with a real history.

    She's been modified for non-traditional construction. Instead of dozens of steam bent ribs,
    laboriously mortised and pegged into the gunwales, there are just a few marine plywood frames. The stems, too, are ply. 
    The result is a boat that is vastly quicker and easier to construct, but looks and performs exactly the same as the original. 
    Other modifications include a standard sized cockpit (18"×30") and a slightly raised masik for more leg room. 
    Neither of these mods influence the handling, at all, and you can certainly build yours with a traditional sized cockpit 
    coaming and less legroom, if you prefer.

      <p class="highlight">17' long, 22" wide, weight about 26lbs (12kg). The Disko Bay is suitable for paddlers up to a maximum of about 205lbs (93kg).</p>
      <p class="highlight">
        If you are a larger paddler, then consider building the <u>DISKO DREADNOUGHT</u>, instead. 
        The DD is an otherwise identical, scaled up version of the Disko Bay, useful for boaters up to 250lbs (113kg).
        Note that either of these boats will be a tight fit if you are approaching the top end of their capacity.
        The Disko Dreadnought is 18' × 23" (5.48m × 58.4cm). When ordering, simply make a note that you want the 
        Disko Dreadnought patterns and I'll send them instead!
