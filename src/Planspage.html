<p>
	All plans sales continue as usual, through Duckworks.com, and when you order below you will be redirected there.
	Kits, however, are not currently available, as I am still on hiatus/sabbatical. Likewise, I am rarely available to
	answer questions,
	for which I apologize. Your best bet is to ask your question on the Duckworks facebook page,
	where there are many knowledgeable builders of my boats.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience, and have fun with your build!</p>
<h3>What you get:</h3>
<p>
	Plans - Boat plans include a comprehensive, well illustrated building guide,
	material and tool requirements and full sized patterns for most every part. The
	construction guide includes complete instructions for building the frame, skinning the hull
	and coating the fabric - as well as sources for fabric and hardware. We want you
	succeed, and the plans reflect that.
</p>
<p>Measurements are in both English and metric.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Instant downloads</strong> are now available for all of our designs. Electronic plans are $10 to $20USD less
	than paper plans,
	there is no shipping charge, and they arrive right away. The caveat is that you will have to have the file of
	templates printed out on
	a large format printer - which most every local print shop will have - for a nominal fee.
</p>
<p>
	All plan sets include full sized templates for most all the plywood parts - frames, stems, transoms, knees, skeg,
	etc.
	Just glue to a sheet of plywood and saw along the lines - no lofting required, and no worries about having misread a
	bunch of measurements.
</p>
<h3>Frame Kits</h3>

	style="float:right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; border: 1px solid #000000;" />
<p>
	Frame kits include the building guide, pre-cut frames, transoms, knees, etc,
	and all the fabric needed to skin your boat. Due to shipping costs and difficulties kits do not include the
	longitudinal
	stringers (Gunwales, chines, keel, et al.), or spars, nor epoxy or fasteners, paint, etc. Sailboat kits do include
	wood for the foils,
	but do not include sails.
</p>
<p>
	Some kits have optional components, so all kits are ordered directly. Send an email to GentryCustomBoats@yahoo.com
	and we will send you a paypal invoice.
	Turnaround time for kits is usually under a week. Shipping is usually less than $50 in the USA.
</p>
<p>Note: We use only BS1088 Okoume marine plywood in our kits - the best, by far.</p>

<h3>Ordering</h3>
<p>As of 2019 - Plans are now being sold through Duckworks!</p>

<p>Duckworks has both paper plans and instantly downloaded pdfs of plans for all of our boats. Prices have not gone up!</p>

<p>*Ordering kits: (Kits not currently available - sorry!) Kits are still ordered via email, from us. The email is in case
there are options to discuss. Send an email, we'll talk, and I will send you a paypal invoice.
Turnaround time for kits is usually under a week. Shipping is usually less than $50 in the USA.</p>

</table>
<p>A plan or kit licenses the purchaser to build a single boat, for non-commercial purposes only. The fee to build a second
boat from the same set of plans is half the original price. If you order plans, but later want a kit instead, we will
deduct the cost of plans from the kit price.</p>
